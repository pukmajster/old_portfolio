                    I'm Å½an, a front-end developer from Slovenia.

                    I started coding at about the age of 11. At some point I ventured into web development and never really looked back. Since then, I've made lots of small little personal projects along with some bigger ones.

                    Most of my work has been done in the React framework, as it is the one I've grown most comfortable with, but I like to learn new things as I discover them.
